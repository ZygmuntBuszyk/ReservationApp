# ReservationApp

Live on Heroku: https://thawing-thicket-37289.herokuapp.com
Login as Doctor: Login: Admin, Pass: Admin
Login as patient: register(or use login: 123, pass: 123)

What i used: 
Node.js, 
MongoDb  --- MongoLab,
jquery,
bootstrap 3,
html,
css,



Problems: 
Too lazy to change --> I've created the wrong dependence on schemas, it should be other way as i recall. 
What it does, is, Doctor(Admin), can't check the pacient's 'profile', if that pacient have no 'active' reserved dates.
Other ways, it works fine .. keeps the User logged and stuff. 
Core calendar script is borrowed. I've added other functionalities to it and worked with it.
Not really happy about looks.
